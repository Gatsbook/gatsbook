Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.  
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework â€“ [Redux Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

- The **[Redux Tutorials](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-tutorials.md)** section of the **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)**.  Here's a top list of our recommended tutorials:
    - Dave Ceddia's posts [What Does Redux Do? (and when should you use it?)](https://daveceddia.com/what-does-redux-do/) and [How Redux Works: A Counter-Example](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/) are a great intro to the basics of Redux and how to use it with React, as is this post on [React and Redux: An Introduction](http://jakesidsmith.com/blog/post/2017-11-18-redux-and-react-an-introduction/).
    - Valentino Gagliardi's post [React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: Learning Redux in 2018](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/) is an excellent extended introduction to many aspects of using Redux.
